# BYTES-NET

Simple botnet that is created with SOCKS and is able to create DDOS (Layer 4) Attacks With bots
## Usage
After running the server.py file you can use these commands to navigate around.

- list_connections : list connected clients.
- build : build a file to connect clients/bots to your precious botnet!
- set_ip : Set IP address of the server you want to attack with your zombies.
- set_port : Set port number of the server you want to attack with your zombies.
- set_threads : More threads, more the damage you can make, but I suggest you to keep that number around 100-5000 for bots to not get disconnected.
- drop_module : drop your ddos module into your clients computer (needed to start a ddos attack) there will be more modules added in the future.
- dos_attack : Start your ddos attack.
- stop_dos : Stop your ddos attack.
